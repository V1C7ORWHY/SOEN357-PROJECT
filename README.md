Study subject 1：walmart.com

Good point: The image is too big, and users can know what products are on sale.

Improvement:Too much advertisement and recommendation, users can't catch the point.

Study subject 2: metro.ca

Good point: The color combination is good.

Improvement:The color is too monotonous.Sometimes, the homepage can feel cluttered with multiple banners, promotions, and pop-ups, making it hard for users to focus.

User personas
==
We created 2 user personas that would represent potential users. This will allow us to better understand our users’ expectations, concerns and motivations.

The first persona is Dr. Thompson Green. He is a chemical scientist. He spends his most time in the lab.

The second persona is Alexandre Martinez. He is a Game Streamer, who stay at home and work at home in the most of time.

User Journey
==

Next, we write a typical daily using routine for my persona. This process helped me decide how the app’s user experience might be designed to fit in with a navigation routine.

User Flow Chart 
==
Now We have an idea of how the website will run. Mapping the basic flow of the website let me to figure each step on the path the users will take throughout the solution.

Storyboard
==
We developed a storyboard. It illustrates the user experience with the website. This approach effectively showcases how the product fits into a broader narrative, providing insight into its real-world application. It's a valuable and cost-effective method for capturing, communicating, and exploring the app's context and usability.

Sketches
==
After deciding on the features and general concepts for the application, I created sketches to outline the layout of the pages, sections, and tabs. Although these sketches were not the final version, they were instrumental in shaping the final design.

Wireframes
==
Based on the sketches, core functionality was presented as a simple grayscale prototype. This allowed the team to focus on the functionality of the application rather than its aesthetics. Early prototypes of Travel.com ensured that users could navigate the system seamlessly and intuitively.

Visual Design
==
Color 
-
Use bright and contrasting colors, such as white and black, to enhance visual effects, and bright colors, such as mint, blue, orange, and pink, to draw users’ attention to the button.

Typography
-
The font is inter, this font is very neat and clean, users can see it clearly, and bold is used on the current page to tell people who are looking at this prototype.
